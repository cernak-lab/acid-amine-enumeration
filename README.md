Each folder contains the stand alone code to produce each figure. Install the specified packages at the top of each python script and run the code to produce the figure. To produce the circos figures, the circos program needs to be installed. Most of the settings are specified in the circos.conf file but other settings may change depending on your installation and local settings. This will cause the final circos to look a bit different but the data should be reperesented similarly nonetheless.
